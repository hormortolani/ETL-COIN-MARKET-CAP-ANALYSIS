# ETL-COIN-MARKET-CAP-ANALYSIS

In my ETL project focused on analyzing Coin Market Cap data, I used Python to web scrape the top 10 cryptocurrencies from the official Coin Market Cap website. The extraction process was carried out in Databricks, followed by data cleaning and manipulation using pandas and PySpark to format the data for analysis. I then applied SQL queries in Databricks to answer key questions, such as:

- Identifying the top 3 cryptocurrencies by market cap.
- Calculating the average percent change over 24 hours.
- Determining the total market cap of cryptocurrencies with a trading volume greater than $1 billion in the last 24 hours.
- Finding the cryptocurrency with the highest price.

After performing these analyses, I saved the cleaned dataset to an existing Databricks database and subsequently transferred it to Power BI for further analysis and visualization. The tools I utilized included Python, PySpark, SQL, and Power BI.
